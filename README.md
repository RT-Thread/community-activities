# Create Better English Documentation!

In the spirit of openness, we are maintaining a documentation center for how we create this project and how you can quickly get started using this project. The original RT-Thread documentation was generated in Chinese and has been translated into English by RT-Thread community developers, Non-English speakers. So after the English documents got published, we received some complaints saying that some expressions in this document are not very understandable and have arisen confusion, especially they're new beginners to learn the embedded system. 

We're here calling embedded developers to help us perfect the documentation. And hopefully, you will also get to know the embedded system at a much deeper level than you're simply using the technology.
